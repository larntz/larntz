### Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal profile. I am interested in Rust, systems programming, Linux KVM, embedded programming, and more. Programming for me is mainly a hobby, but I do some light work with python, ansible and powershell if that counts, and c# and rust (when I can) at work. 

Planning to add more here in the coming months, but for now stay safe ðŸ˜· and shoot for the stars ðŸš€ lol
