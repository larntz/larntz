## Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am an SRE living in South Florida. Part of a multi-cultural family and love it! Cleveland sports fan. When I'm not behind the screen I enjoy being outdoors beaching, paddle boarding, kayaking, and enjoying the ðŸ˜Ž sun.

### Professional Skills

I am interested in contributing to open source projects, mentoring and being mentored, and working on professional teams that place high value on collaboration, planning, and quality work.

I've worked extensively with IaC, Kubernetes, observability, and CICD. 

I also enjoy writing technical documentation, because it's a great way to share knowledge and improve operational efficiency. I look at troubleshooting like solving a puzzle. There is always an answer to found if you are methodical and persistent. 

Principals and technologies I'm specifically interested in are:

- Kubernetes: building operators, service mesh, and advanced workload deployment strategies.
- IaC: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK and similar tooling.
- GitHub Actions and other modern CICD platforms.
- Go and Python
- Prometheus and Grafana 
- NALSD
